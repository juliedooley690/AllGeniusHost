- **Clear Messaging:** Highlight a single idea to avoid confusing your audience.
- **Focused CTAs:** Limit the page to one or two clear calls-to-action (CTAs) for better results.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid When Capturing Leads

Here are some pitfalls to watch out for:

1. **Too Many CTAs:** Asking visitors to subscribe, download, and purchase all on one page dilutes your message and reduces effectiveness.
2. **Distracting Design:** Over-the-top animations and irrelevant images can push potential leads away.
3. **Lack of Trust Builders:** Missing testimonials, case studies, or security badges can reduce visitor confidence.
